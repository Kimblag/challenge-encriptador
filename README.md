# Challenge Decoder Oracle - Alura Latam

This decoder was a project carried out for the Alura Latam and Oracle challenge for the Oracle Next Education (ONE) educational program.

## How does it work? 
It consists of an encoder that takes a text entered by the user and encrypts it using an encryption algorithm indicated by the teachers.

<ul>
<li>`The letter "e" is converted to "enter"`</li>
<li>`The letter "i" is converted to "imes"`</li>
<li>`The letter "a" is converted to "ai"`</li>
<li>`The letter "o" is converted to "ober"`</li>
<li>`The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"`</li>
</ul>


**Requirements:**
- Should work only with lowercase letters
- Letters with accents or special characters should not be used
- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version as well as return an encrypted word to its original version.
